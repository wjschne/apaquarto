Installing apaquarto is not hard, but it takes a bit more effort than installing a standalone program. There are four main steps:

1. Install Quarto
2. Install a programming language (e.g., R, Python, Julia)
3. Install a programming environment (e.g., RStudio, Positron, VS Code, Jupyter) 
4. Install apaquarto


## Install Quarto

The current stable version of Quarto can be installed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). 

If you use a recent version of [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), Quarto is already installed. If you are not sure if your version of Quarto is recent enough, there is no harm in re-installing it.

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
## How to check which version of Quarto is installed

In a [terminal](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/terminal.html), run

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| filename: "Terminal"
quarto --version
```


:::

## Install a Programming Language 

Your primary options are

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
3. [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
 

:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}

### What if I do not want to use any programming languages?

If you just want to use apaquarto to make APA-style documents, but do not plan to do any analyses, install R and RStudio. You do not need R for anything, but the Quarto experience will be easier in RStudio with R installed.
:::


## Install your programming environment

At the [same link for installing Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), there are links for selecting an environment for using Quarto. Your options include:

1. [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) will probably give the smoothest experience to anyone new to data analysis. It is made by Posit, the same company that makes Quarto.
2. [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) is made by Posit, the same company that makes Quarto and RStudio. It inspired by RStudio but is multi-lingual by design. It works well, but Positron is still in beta testing and the experience of using it is not quite as smooth as that of RStudio. Positron will likely become the default recommendation on this list when it is further along in its development.
3. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works for any language. Some R users really like VS Code, but those who do will likely migrate to Positron because Positron is a data-science-specific fork of VS Code.
4. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), as its name indicates, works with `Ju`lia, `Pyt`hon, and `R`.
5. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), a hyperextensible Vim-based text editor
6. [Any text editor](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html) will do. Everyone has options---Quarto won't box you in.

# Install apaquarto

What do you wish to do with apaquarto? You can create a new template file in a new project folder, or you can add the apaquarto format to an existing Quarto file.

There are two ways to install Quarto extensions like apaquarto: If you are an R user, you might prefer the R console method. Anyone, including R users, can use the terminal method.


:::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}

### Via the terminal

First open the the terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to install apaquarto.




:::{.panel-tabset .nav.pills}

#### To create a new file

Run this in the terminal:

```{bash}
#| filename: "Terminal"
#| eval: false
quarto use template wjschne/apaquarto
```

#### Convert an existing document

Run this in the terminal:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| filename: "Terminal"
quarto add wjschne/apaquarto
```

:::

Entering the command above will prompt a question about whether you trust [the author](https://wjschne.github.io/) of the extension to not run malicious code. If you answer Yes, you will be prompted to name a new folder where the extension will be installed. Do not enter a complete file path. Just supply a folder name. This folder will be created in the folder you have navigated to.

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

#### What is the terminal?

A terminal is an interface for telling your computer what to do. A terminal can be pulled up on most programming environments. For example, In RStudio, the terminal is in a tab next to the console (see @fig-console). If you cannot see a terminal tab next to the console, use the keyboard shortcut Alt-Shift-R to make a terminal appear (or  select *Tools &rarr; Terminal &rarr; New Terminal.* in the RStudio menu).

![RStudio terminal. It is okay if your console looks different from mine.](img/terminal.png){#fig-terminal}

Alternatively, you can open a terminal directly on any computer:

1. [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/terminal/welcome/mac): Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.
2. [Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows): Click the Windows Start Icon (or press the {{< kbd Win >}} key), type `cmd`, select Command Prompt.
3. [Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu): Press {{< kbd Ctrl+Alt+T >}}

#### How to nagivate to a folder

Suppose there is a folder on your computer at this location:

`C:/Users/myname/Documents/MyProject/`

The `cd` command means "change directory." Thus, entering this command will "navigate" you to your desired folder:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| filename: "Terminal"
cd "C:/Users/myname/Documents/MyProject/"
```


:::


:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

## Pasting commands into the terminal

In many terminals, the "paste" shortcut is different from what you might be used to (i.e., {{< kbd Ctrl+Shift+V >}} instead of {{< kbd Ctrl+V >}}). If that does not work, try right-clicking and selecting `paste`. If all else fails, just type the command.

:::

### Via the R console

If you are an R user, you can install extensions with the [quarto package](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/) using the R Console. 

1. Set the working directory to the folder where you want the template to be installed. 
2. In the R console, run this code:

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}

#### Create a new file

```{r consoletemplate}
#| eval: false
quarto::quarto_use_template("wjschne/apaquarto")
```


#### Convert an existing document

```{r}
#| eval: false
quarto::quarto_add_extension("wjschne/apaquarto")
```

:::



A prompt will ask if you trust  [the author](https://wjschne.github.io/) not to place malicious code on your machine. To proceed, answer `Yes` or just `Y`.



:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

#### What is the R Console?

The console is for entering R commands.  In RStudio, it is in the lower left pane by default. See @fig-console. It is okay if your console looks different from mine.

![RStudio console](img/console.png){#fig-console}

To use the console, type a command and press {{< kbd Enter >}}.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

#### What is the quarto package?

The quarto package is not Quarto itself, but it provides convenient functions to  interact with Quarto. You will need a recent version of the quarto package (version 1.4 or higher).

If the quarto package is not installed, you can can install it by running this code in the console:

```{r installquartopackage}
#| eval: false
install.packages("quarto")
```

Alternatively, in RStudio's lower right pane:

1. Select the **Packages** tab.
2. Click the **Install** button.
3. Enter "quarto" in the input box.
4. Click **Install**.

## How to set the working directory

Suppose there is a folder on your computer at this location:

`C:/Users/myname/Documents/MyProject/`


You can set the working directory in the R console with this command

```{r setworkingdirectory}
#| eval: false
setwd("C:/Users/myname/Documents/MyProject/")
```


Alternatively, you can set the working directory in the RStudio menu:

1. Select *Session &rarr; Set Working Directory &rarr; Choose Directory*

![Set Working Directory Via RStudio Menu](img/menuworkingdirectory.png)

2. Navigate to a folder where you want to create a new folder.

#### How to skip the prompts

Run the `quarto_use_template` function with the `no_prompt` option set to `TRUE`:

```{r skipprompts}
#| eval: false
quarto::quarto_use_template("wjschne/apaquarto", no_prompt = TRUE)
```

:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

#### How to inspect the code before installing it

The apaquarto source code is in [this repository](https://github.com/wjschne/apaquarto). Installing the extension will install the contents of the `_extensions/apaquarto` folder. If you install the template, it will install the `template.qmd` file and rename it to the name of the folder you install the template to. In addition, these files will be installed:

- bibliography.bib
- README.md
- example.qmd

::::

### After installing apaquarto



If you made a...

#### A new file

If you create a new apaquarto file, you will see a template file in the folder you select. The template file will have the same name as the folder you installed the template to and ends with `.qmd`. 


The example.qmd file has most of the options already filled out and explains how and why to change them. It also has a examples of how to use the extension in the text.

It is recommended for RStudio users to use apaquarto inside a project. To create project for an existing directory, see  [here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects). 


#### An existing file

Once the extension is installed, you still need to change the output format of your document. You can select one or more of three formats: .docx, .pdf, or .html. You can add all of these formats or any combination of them:

To include all four formats, add this to your .qmd file's yaml `format` option:

``` yaml
format:
  apaquarto-docx: default
  apaquarto-html: default
  apaquarto-pdf: default
  apaquarto-typst: default
```

When writing, I prefer to output to .html, because it renders quickly. Then I switch to .docx or .pdf, depending on where I need to submit the paper.


Here is a minimal example of what the YAML metadata might look like:

``` yaml
