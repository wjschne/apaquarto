## APA-Style Helper Functions in R

Many packages have helper functions for reporting statistics in and creating tables and figures in APA Style. Here are a few:

## Alternatives to apaquarto

To my knowledge, there is no working quarto extension other than apaquarto that takes a comprehensive approach to APA style with output options in .docx, .html, and .pdf. However, there are other ways to automate the production of APA-style documents. 

### APA style with knitr and $\LaTeX$

The ability to automate APA style via $\LaTeX$ has been around for some time---first via [apa](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa) (APA Style, 5th Edition), then via [apa6](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa6) (APA Style, 6th Edition), and now via [apa7](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) (APA Style, 7th Edition). The apaquarto package uses [apa7](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) to create .pdf documents. To intermingle R code and $\LaTeX$ code in the same document, R-users could write in an .Rnw file using [sweave or knitr](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr). I still do so when I need the full flexibility of $\LaTeX$.

### APA style with Rmarkdown and papaja

Unfortunately, most psychology journals require submissions in MS Word (and most collaborators do as well). Learning $\LaTeX$ is fun for some people (e.g., me), but most will not bother. With the arrival of Rmarkdown, it became possible to automate document production with a system that takes just a few minutes to learn. 

The [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) package by Frederick Aust uses Rmarkdown syntax and does a fantastic job of creating APA-style (6th Edition) documents in .pdf and [gets close to perfect .docx output](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/limitations.html#microsoft-word-documents). With a bit of tweaking, [papaja can do most of APA Style (7th Edition)](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues/342) for .pdf documents.
