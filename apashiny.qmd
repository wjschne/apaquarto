Keeping track of apquarto's many options can be difficult, and with each new feature, the list of options grows. I have make a small app that makes it easier to create the initial apaquarto document. 

The app can be accessed [here](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7maker/).

The app is mostly self-explanatory. You fill in necessary information or select options that suit your purpose. When ready, click `Make Document` in the side menu and then click `Update`. Copy the resulting text into an existing Quarto file.
