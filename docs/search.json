    "text": "A good place to start learning about writing Quarto documents is here. I will cover material needed to use apaquarto to write an APA Style document in Markdown text.\nMarkdown makes writing in a consistent style straightforward and easy. Its plain-text format was designed to be easy to read and easy to write, yet also flexible and specific enough that it could be converted automatically into fully formatted documents.\nIf you are used to writing with a word processor (e.g., MS Word, Google Docs), it might feel disconcerting to not see what the document will look like as you type. This feeling will pass, and the benefits of typing in a plain-text format will become evident. While writing in APA style, the plain-text Markdown approach prevents the introduction of many inconsistencies and makes it much easier to spot and fix any inconsistencies that are already present."

    "text": "Block Quotes and Suppressing Indentation\nSometimes you want to give a longer quote that needs to go in its own paragraph. Block quotes are on their own line starting with the &gt; character. For example, Jane Austen’s (1814/1990) Mansfield Park has some memorable insights about the mind:\n\n&gt; If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. (p. 163)\n\nIf your quote has multiple paragraphs, like this passage from Brown (2012), separate them with a lone &gt; character between the lines:\n\n\n&gt; In the entire field of astronomy, there is no word other than planet that has a precise, lawyerly definition, in which certain criteria are specifically enumerated. Why does planet have such a definition but star, galaxy, and giant molecular cloud do not? Because in astronomy, as in most sciences, scientists work by concepts rather than by definitions. The concept of a star is clear; a star is a collection of gas with fusion reactions in the interior giving off energy. A galaxy is a large, bound collection of stars. A giant molecular cloud is a giant cloud of molecules. The concept of a planet—in the eight-planet solar system—is equally simple to state. A planet is a one of a small number of bodies that dominate a planetary system. That is a concept, not a definition. How would you write that down in a precise definition?\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn’t. Once you write down a definition with lawyerly precision, you get the lawyers involved in deciding whether or not your objects are planets. Astronomers work in concepts. We rarely call in the attorneys for adjudication. (p. 242)\nIf the text after a quote is a new paragraph, you can create it in the usual fashion (i.e., plain text with an empty line between the block text and the new paragraph). However, if the text after a quote is part of the same paragraph, you can suppress the indentation by creating a div with the .NoIndent class. As an example:\nInitial paragraph\n\n&gt; Block quote paragraph\n\n:::{.NoIndent}\nBecause this sentence continues the initial paragraph, \nthe indentation is suppresed.\n:::"

Contains definitions, abbreviations, and other information needed to understand the table, as well as copyright information.\nSpecific Note. These are notes about specific cells in the table, often in form of footnotes with lowercase letters as markers. Each footnote is in the same paragraph. The APA Manual recommends making the the footnote marker in superscript. The space that separates the marker from the the explanatory text should also be in superscript, hence the ^&nbsp;^ at the beginning of th footnote text.\nProbability Note. This note explains the meanings of probability markers (e.g., * p &lt; .05; ** p &lt; .001; *** p &lt; .001).\n\nYou can add a general note below a figure or table with the chunk option apa-note.

You can “mask” any citation you wish by setting the mask field in the metadata yaml to true. Then list all citations that need to be masked in the masked-citations field like so:\nmask: true\nmasked-citations:\n  - schneider2015intelligence\n  - schneider2012cattell\nIf the mask field is set to false, the masked citations will print as usual. When mast is true, depending if they are an inline or parenthetical citations, they will be listed as “Masked Citations (n.d)” or “(Masked Citations, n.d)”. In parenthetical citations, it is possible to mix masked and unmasked citations.\nSetting mask to true will also remove the authors, affiliations, and author notes from the title page."

    "text": "Style guides facilitate scientific communication. Because scholars often write about inherently difficult topics, preventing any avoidable barriers to communication is all the more necessary. Style guides make information easier to absorb because it is presented in a predictable sequence and a familiar format. Still, in removing unnecessary barriers to communication on the reader’s end, style guides themselves often place unnecessary roadblocks before the writer.\nAPA style is fussier than most discipline-specific guides. Because it was introduced in the pre-computer age (Bentley et al. 1929), its quirks and charms resist easy automation. Even after decades of experience, I still need to look things up. Constantly. The basics of APA style are easy enough to learn, but there are a lot of particulars to keep in mind. Not only are there rules and exceptions to rules to remember, there are exceptions to the exceptions that must not be forgotten.\nI wrote apaquarto so that I would never have to worry about APA style ever again. With very little extra effort, your documents are formatted according to APA style. In Figure 1 we see an example of apaquarto’s output to “manuscript mode”. Switching the document to “journal model, produces output formatted like an APA journal (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead.\n\n\nFigure 1: Example document in manuscript mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead.\n\n\nFigure 2: Example document in journal mode\n\n\n\n\nQuarto makes writing scientific documents easier\nThe apaquarto extension is built on Quarto, an open-source publishing system specifically adapted for scientific and technical documents such as journal articles, books, blogs, slides, and dashboards, and websites. Not only does Quarto offer considerable flexibility by itself, it was designed to be extensible. Thus, Quarto can take care of most of the formatting, and an extension can be written to handle whatever specific formatting rules a style guide requires. The apaquarto extension takes care of all the fussy details of APA-style so that you can focus on the content of your writing.\nYou do not need to know any programming languages to use Quarto. You can use it in a completely non-technical way to write well-formatted text, tables, figures, and references. However, if your document communicates the results from data analyses, then Quarto offers you something quite remarkable. You can perform your analyses and communicate your findings in the same file! That is, you write text and code together in a source document and then you “render” the document into its final format (e.g., .html, .pdf, .docx). So instead of performing your analyses elsewhere (e.g., SPSS) and then copying the results into a word processor (e.g., MS Word), you build your document in one step.\nThe advantages of this kind of workflow are profound. If you discover a mistake in your analysis, there is no need to find and replace the primary results and their downstream consequences scattered throughout the document. Instead, you just re-render the document, and everything in it is updated. When the document is published, the Quarto file serves as a fully reproducible record of your analysis. Making the Quarto file available in a public repository increases trust in your work because anyone can inspect it and trace any result you report back to the source code that created it.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBentley, Madison, CA Peerenboom, FW Hodge, Edward B Passano, HC Warren, and MF Washburn. 1929. “Instructions in Regard to Preparation of Manuscript.” Psychological Bulletin 26 (2): 57."

However, there are other ways to automate the production of APA-style documents.\n\nAPA style with knitr and \\(\\LaTeX\\)\nThe ability to automate APA style via \\(\\LaTeX\\) has been around for some time—first via apa (APA Style, 5th Edition), then via apa6 (APA Style, 6th Edition), and now via apa7 (APA Style, 7th Edition). The apaquarto package uses apa7 to create .pdf documents. To intermingle R code and \\(\\LaTeX\\) code in the same document, R-users could write in an .Rnw file using sweave or knitr. I still do so when I need the full flexibility of \\(\\LaTeX\\).\n\n\nAPA style with Rmarkdown and papaja\nUnfortunately, most psychology journals require submissions in MS Word (and most collaborators do as well). Learning \\(\\LaTeX\\) is fun for some people (e.g., me), but most will not bother. With the arrival of Rmarkdown, it became possible to automate document production with a system that takes just a few minutes to learn.\nThe papaja package by Frederick Aust uses Rmarkdown syntax and does a fantastic job of creating APA-style (6th Edition) documents in .pdf and gets close to perfect .docx output. With a bit of tweaking, papaja can do most of APA Style (7th Edition) for .pdf documents."
