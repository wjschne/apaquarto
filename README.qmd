title: "A Quarto Extension for Creating APA 7 Style Documents"
format: gfm
editor: source
---

![Experimental](lifecycle-experimental.svg)

This article template creates [APA Style 7th Edition documents](https://apastyle.apa.org/) in .docx, .html. and .pdf.

If you want to type in markdown to create a document in the APA 6th Edition format, I suggest using [papaja](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/).

If you need all the flexibility of $\LaTeX$, I suggest using the [apa7 document class](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) with knitr and the [.Rnw format](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr).

## Creating a New Article

To create a new article using this format, run this command in the terminal:

``` bash
quarto use template wjschne/apaquarto
```

In RStudio, the terminal is a tab next to the console. If you cannot see a terminal tab next to the console, use the keyboard shortcut Alt-Shift-R to make a terminal appear.

Entering the command above will prompt a question about whether you trust the author of the extension to not run malicious code. If you answer Yes, you will be prompted to name a new folder where the extension will be installed with an example document with the name of the folder and a file extension of .qmd. The example document has most of the instructions you will likely need.

## Using with an Existing Document

To add this format to an existing document:

``` bash
quarto add wjschne/apaquarto
```

Then, add the format to your document options:

``` yaml
format:
  apaquarto-docx: default
```

When adding this extension to an existing document, you will need to add this line to the document right after its YAML metadata: (Note: The [include statement](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) needs to be surrounded by empty lines.)

```{markdown}

{{{< include _extensions/wjschne/apaquarto/_apa_title.qmd >}}}


```

Here is an example of what the YAML metadata and the "include" statement below it might look like:
